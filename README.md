# DocPrompter
This is a simple telepromter web app which loads a Google Drive document and, well, teleprompts it.

Honestly, I was surprised nobody has made something like this yet (or at least I couldn't find it).

The settings are mirrored in the URL, so once you've got a configuration you like, you can copy the URL and use it anywhere 
(as long as that anywhere still has access to your Google account).

There aren't very many settings or controls - you can:
- Load a file from Google Drive
- Reload the same file (if, say, you edited the doc on the computer and are telepromtping on a tablet/phone)
- Adjust the text size and scroll speed
- Mirror the text or not
- Make it scroll as soon as you press the "Start" button or not
- Start and stop scrolling by pressing the spacebar

The app is hosted right [here](https://yanamal.github.io/DocPrompter) via GitHub Pages. 
It's an entirely client-side app (obviously, since it's hosted directly on GitHub) and it does not save or use any information about you, except for displaying the contents of a google doc you have access to.
